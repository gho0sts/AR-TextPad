# AR-TextPad
Typing in Augmented Reality demo.

A prototype showing how to display a textView in head-worn ARKit, and type to it with a keyboard.

_(Found this old demo laying around, and thought it might be helpful for others to riff off.)_

Written in XCode 10.0 for iOS 11.3 and above.
Running: Scenekit. 
NOTE: A Bluetooth Wireless Keyboard is required.
NOTE: An AR see-through headset like the Merge VR is required.
