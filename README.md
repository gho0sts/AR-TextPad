# AR-TextPad
Prototype showing typing in ARKit (see-through Augmented Reality).

Found this old demo laying around, and thought it might be useful to others.

# Process

1. Added ARSCNStereoViewClass for Stereo Vision (see other Github repo https://github.com/hanleyweng/iOS-ARKit-Headset-View )

2. Add in Text View and clone it into AR Scenes.
